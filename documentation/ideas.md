# Conceptual Ideas

- Center the website around a calendar (conceptually and physically the calendar should be the majority of the screen)
- Allow user to create buckets/task types
  - For Example: work, home, appointments, errands
  - Each task type would have it's own list and color
  - Once assigned a bucket, the task would show up in that color on the calendar

### User Profiles

For the app maybe having it being a family oriented. Everyone has smart phones for the most part, so maybe on the app everyone can communicate household cores in it, as well as things the family has going on.
The calendar for the web page could be for mom and dad where they can place events and task there then once we apply the app you can add your kids to it.
Kids can check in with homework------Maybe even having teachers connected in a way as well?
